#  Docker Image For Visual Studio Code

This Docker image will allow us to run the amazing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) without the need to
install it in our computers.

At same time it will be easy to keep *Visual Studio Code* synchronized acrros several computers.

This package belongs to a serie of other packages, that have the goal of making our *Development Environment*:

* easy and fast to install in any computer.
* simple to synchronize accross computers.
* easy to configure for each programming language and test new setups by using profiles.
* separated from our OS, so that we can have a clean OS that will allow us to upgrade it fast and easily.
* more secure, once *Docker Containers* run in isolation and are destroyed on exit, therefore if they are compromised it ends there.
